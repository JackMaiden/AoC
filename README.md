# AoC C# Challenge runner

This project is a C# Runner for AoC Challenges see: https://adventofcode.com/

How do you run this project?

Start by creating a Y20XX folder (in \Challenges\Challenge copy Y0 for ease) for the Adevent of Code challenges you would like to attempt. 

Adevnt Of Code is 2014 (the start of AoC) and after is supported, by default you can run the specific day (Today) or All challenges by running either of the Command Line projects, these can easily be amended to run other challenges if you desire.

For Each Day, Create a DayXX folder, a DayXX.cs, data.input files.

See Y2010 as an example of the format.

Implement your challenge and run, then submit the result.

After you can pull any changes from main. This repo only changes core functionality so unless you change that it should work as expected.
